## Core Technical Specifications

### 1. Entity Component System (ECS)

The game will use a custom ECS architecture to manage game objects and behavior:

- **Entities**: Unique IDs representing game objects (player, enemies, weapons, etc.)
- **Components**: Pure data attached to entities (position, health, weapon stats)
- **Systems**: Functions that operate on entities with specific components

Implementation details:

- Create a lightweight and efficient custom ECS implementation
- Define a core set of component types
- Create system functions that query entities with specific component combinations
- Implement an entity factory for creating common game objects
- Support for component addition/removal at runtime
- Dependency management between systems
- Event system for communication between systems

### 2. Game Loop and Rendering

- Implement time-based updates for consistent gameplay across different frame rates
- Configure a proper camera and scene setup for the FPS perspective
- Use @react-three/postprocessing for advanced visual effects

### 3. Player System
